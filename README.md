# COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis

## Project Overview
This data science project analyzes global COVID-19 vaccination data to understand vaccination progress across different countries. The analysis includes vaccination rates, trends, and comparative studies between countries.

## Data Source
Data is sourced from Our World in Data's COVID-19 vaccination dataset:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of vaccination trends
- Statistical analysis of vaccination rates
- Country-wise comparative analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
